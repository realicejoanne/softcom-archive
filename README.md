# What is Soft Computing?
Soft computing is a computing model evolved to solve the non-linear problems which involve uncertain, imprecise and approximate solutions of a problem. Soft computing employs fuzzy logic and probabilistic reasoning while hard computing is based on binary or crisp systems. Also, soft computing produces approximate results while hard computing generates precise results.

Tools: MATLAB

In Soft Computing, there are several methods I learned:
1. Fuzzy System
2. ANN
3. Neuro-Fuzzy
4. Evolving ANN
5. Evolving Fuzzy System
